This repository contains an (unofficial) LaTeX template for University of L'Aquila presentations

The class file "univaqslides.cls" along with the "imgs" folder is everything needed.
In addition, this repository contains a sample TeX file "main.tex" to show the basic usage

Feel free to contact me for suggestions
